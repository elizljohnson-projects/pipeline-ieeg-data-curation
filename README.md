# pipeline-ieeg-data-curation
**Pipeline for curating intracranial EEG data**

These scripts read and process raw intracranial EEG (iEEG) data to standardize and prepare the data for analysis. The scripts also read and process MRI and CT scans to reconstruct the iEEG electrode positions in native and MNI space, and merge the MNI coordinates with the ready-to-analyze iEEG data. The resulting data are in a standardized MATLAB structure in FieldTrip format, enabling use in MATLAB (with or without FieldTrip) and straightforward conversion to other formats such as Python.

The pipeline is described in:

Software:
- MATLAB 8.6 (R2021b; last tested with R2024b)
- FieldTrip (last tested with fieldtrip-20250114) - [download](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download/)
- FreeSurfer 7.1 - [download](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall)

Notes:
- Functions must be run in order from #0-6.
- The two functions #0 can be run in any order. Function #1 reads the outputs of both functions #0.
- Function #1 reconstructs the iEEG electrode positions, analysis described in: Stolk, A, Griffin, S, van der Meij, R et al. Integrated analysis of anatomical and electrophysiological human intracranial data. _Nature Protocols_ 13 (2018). [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-018-0009-6)
- Function #1 requires FieldTrip templates of the standard MNI brain (which are too big for GitHub) - [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qWP-v-ytWxXUuKWydSksg1X1hvZjBi8P/view?usp=sharing)
- Function #4 timestamps the data and is necessarily task-specific. It corresponds to the [working memory delayed match to sample experimental paradigm](https://github.com/elizljohnson-projects/paradigm-working-memory-dms.git). It may be used as a template for other tasks, permitting read in from the outputs of function #3 and read out to function #5.
- All other functions are task-agnostic.
